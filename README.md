# Time Series Forecasting Projects

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating time series
analysis and forecasting techniques using real-world datasets. The
projects focus on understanding temporal patterns, model assumptions,
and forecast evaluation.

## Notebooks

### 1. forecasting.ipynb
A foundational notebook covering core time series concepts, including:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Trend and seasonality visualization
- Stationarity testing using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test
- Model comparison using ARIMA and SARIMA

This notebook focuses on building intuition around classical time series
methods.

### 2. MNC_forecasting.ipynb
An applied forecasting project using real-world business data to predict
monthly sales for a multinational corporation.

Key steps include:
- Time series visualization and trend analysis
- Model building using Prophet
- Forecast evaluation using error metrics
- Interpretation of results for business decision-making

---

## Key Results (MNC_forecasting.ipynb)

- **RMSE:** 908.53  
- **MAE:** 23.56  

The model demonstrates stable performance for monthly sales forecasting
and effectively captures underlying trends and seasonality.
